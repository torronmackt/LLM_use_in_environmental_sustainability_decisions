As a decision maker in the Department of Energy of the United States, I have the following situation. The US needs minerals such as cobalt and nickel for high-end electronics and wants to reduce its dependency on supply from China. The aim is to identify supply alternatives and evaluate their impact. 
Example 1: mine for critical minerals in the US. 
Example 2: increase sourcing of minerals from Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Example 3: increase in recycled and recovered metals. 
Example 4: deep sea mining. Provide other alternatives if any. For each alternative, evaluate the economic impact, and evaluate the environmental impact. 
Advise on the best sourcing strategy and justify your decision. Indicate what information sources were used.
