The COP30 climate summit will be held in Belem, Brazil, in 2030.
10000 participants will attend from all over the world.
To create the needed hosting infrastructure the following alternatives are possible
Example 1: Fell a large part of the Amazon forest to build a road from the city to the venue.
Example 2: Displace part the population in Belem before and during the venue, but not build the road.
Example 3: Host the venue elsewhere near the Amazon.
Example 4: Host the guests on a ship off coast.
Choose the best alternative and explain why.
