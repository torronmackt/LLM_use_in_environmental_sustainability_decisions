The French town of Colmar started handing out free chickens to its residents to reduce food waste. In another French town called Pincé, ­two chickens were offered to each household to help them cut down on organic waste. Chickens have been handed out in the cities of Mouscron and Antwerp and the province of Limburg, although residents had to sign an agreement not to eat the chickens for at least two years.
