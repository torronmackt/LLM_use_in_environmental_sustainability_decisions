Description of the work:
Master Thesis - Effectiveness of Closed-Source AI Models in Environmental Sustainability Tasks: Insights from Few-shot Learning Experiments

This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can support environmental sustainability decisions. By exploring how these models generalize patterns, adapt to variations in input, and manage noise, the research evaluates the effectiveness of LLM use in the context of environmental challenges. We first focus on choosing the relevant indicators to assess LLM responses by a human rater, based on research literature review.  Next, we explore the boundaries and behavior of LLMs answering to domain related prompts. We finally assess LLMs in-context learning capabilities based on few-shot learning, without requiring parameter updates. For the experimental prompts we use cases from environmental sustainability related areas such as pollution, energy management, waste reduction, and climate change mitigation.
By conducting this work, we target every person interested in using LLMs to support their decisions regarding environmental sustainability. We conduct 25 experiments by executing zero-shot and N-shot prompts using a LLM-based conversational AI tool (MS Copilot).  We show strengths and weaknesses of LLM responses and analyze these in detail from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. By doing so, we uncover an error rate of 39% across all prompts and a average score of 3,28 on 5 for execution of zero-shot prompts. We then show empirically using N-shot techniques in the prompt that the score improves to 3.97 on 5 thanks to LLM in-context learning capabilities.

The present work addresses the following questions:
1.	How effectively can closed-source LLMs generalize environmental sustainability tasks with minimal examples (few-shot learning)?
2.	What impact does prompt structure have on the model’s ability to process and make decisions related to environmental sustainability?
3.	Can LLMs transfer knowledge from general domain tasks (e.g., text generation) to specialized environmental sustainability tasks (e.g., energy optimization)?
4.	How do LLMs handle noise or ambiguity in sustainability-related input data (e.g., incomplete environmental reports, conflicting sustainability metrics)?
5.	What are the strengths and limitations of LLMs in providing actionable insights for environmental sustainability decisions based on few-shot learning?

Our contribution is threefold. First, we distill from the reviewed literature and own contribution a set of indicators for assessing LLMs responses to inferences triggered by a human operator. Instead of focusing on LLMs speed and latency performance, the indicators cover aspects relevant for supporting decision-making, such as ethics, interpretability, errors, accuracy and completeness of responses. We propose a rating scale for manually quantifying LLM’s responses.  Second, we create and execute a series of experiments that uncover some relevant boundaries and rules applied by LLMs for generating responses, as well as patterns found in the responses. We explore the aspect of in-context learning by LLMs and deliver insights based on empirical work.  Third, we provide a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results, analyze the findings across various experiments, and draw conclusions on the added value of learning capabilities of LLMs for the area of environmental sustainability decision-making, indicating relevant strengths and limitations.

In short, we conduct methodological work leveraging a set of indicators for assessing LLMs responses and conduct empirical work that uncovers LLMs behavioral patterns indicating LLMs learning and support potential for environmental sustainability decision-making.
